## Batch update

The logic in this script comes from the second part of the tutorial link.

[How can I change the author name / email of a commit?](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/change-author-name-email)

See also SO question:

[Could I change my name and surname in all previous commits?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4493936/could-i-change-my-name-and-surname-in-all-previous-commits)

An answer there provides a solution with a snippet. But, a comment for the
answer links to an improved script:

- [Changing author info](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-author-info/)

This script is limited to replace the email address, while the Git user's name
is left unaffected. See the links above for how to set that too.


## Individual update

See [Authors](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/dev-cheatsheets/cheatsheets/version-control/git/authors.html) guide to change one commit at a time.
