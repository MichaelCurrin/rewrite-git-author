# Usage

Navigate to your repo.

Make to sure to be in the **root**, since when you rebase you are rewinding the history to when there were **zero** directories and then you'll get an error.

Reference it by its full path.

```sh
$ ~/scripts/rewrite_author.sh
```

Or run from your `~/bin` directory from anywhere.

```sh
$ rewrite_author.sh
```
